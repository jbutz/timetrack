# Time Tracker
Time Tracker is a small one-user application to help you track your time. I use it to keep track of my hours at work. I was doing this with a spreadsheet, but decided something a little more automated would be nice. Time Tracker is built with Ruby and Sinatra and can be deployed to Heroku without any modifications. Just set the necessary environment variables.

## Configuration

### Config File
Set your local timezone in `./config/config.yml`. The default is set to Eastern Time.

### Environment Variables
There are three environment variables you need to set `G_API_CLIENT`, `G_API_SECRET`, and `VALID_EMAIL`. Setting `SESSION_SECRET` is optional but encouraged.

* `G_API_CLIENT` - Google API Client ID
* `G_API_SECRET` - Google API Client Secret
* `VALID_EMAIL` - A string of e-mail addresses that can use the application
* `SESSION_SECRET` - A random string used with encoding sessions

To get your Google API client id and secret you will need to use the [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/).
